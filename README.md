OnlyBalds is a Blazor application with a dedicated Web API for backend operations. It's designed to provide a seamless user experience for our bald community.

## :file_folder: Projects

The solution contains three projects:

1. **Blazor Server**: This project handles the server-side rendering of the Blazor application.
2. **Blazor Client**: This project is responsible for the client-side logic and UI of the Blazor application.
3. **Web API**: This project provides the backend for frontend (BFF) implementations, serving as the bridge between the Blazor application and the database.

## :books: Entity Framework with Npgsql for PostgreSQL

OnlyBalds uses **Entity Framework Core** with **Npgsql** to interface with a PostgreSQL database, ensuring efficient data handling and easy integration.

### Database Migrations

1. Create a migration:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef migrations add MigrationName
   ```
2. Apply the migration:
   ```bash
   dotnet ef database update
   ```

This approach leverages the repository pattern and multiple DbContexts (e.g., `ThreadDataContext`, `PostDataContext`, `CommentDataContext`) to organize and handle data effectively.

## :heart: Health Checks

The application includes health check support to monitor service health. Access health information at `/HealthChecks`:

- **/HealthChecks**: Displays the application's current health status.

## :wrench: Build Information

Build information is automatically generated at each build and accessible at the `/build-info.html` endpoint. This page provides key details like:

- Build date and time
- Commit hash
- Build version

## ðŸ¤– Hugging Face API Integration

OnlyBalds integrates with the **Hugging Face Inference API** to enhance chat room moderation using AI models:

- **Toxic BERT**: Identifies potentially toxic messages to maintain a respectful environment.
- **Twitter Sentiment**: Analyzes sentiment to ensure positive interactions within the chat.

## :computer: Running the Project Locally

To run the OnlyBalds application locally, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Run the BFF Backend

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd OnlyBalds`
3. Run the BFF backend with the following command:
```sh
dotnet run --project OnlyBalds.Api --launch-profile https
```

### Step 2: Run the Client Application

To run the OnlyBalds client application:

1. Create a launch profile in the properties directory.
2. Use VS Code's debug section to run the profile created in the previous steps.
